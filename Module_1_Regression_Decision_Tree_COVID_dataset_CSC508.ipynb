        "Lucy Moctezuma - Learned how to code by taking online courses and by using it at work. She took the Science Coding Immersion Program (SCIP) Summer of 2021 sponsored by Dr. Pennings and has since learned Python and R programming languages. She is helping us with the coding part of the workshops, and she is also helping one of the CoDE lab teams in a machine learning project. \n",

        "Lorena Benitez-Rivera - Started learning how to code by taking computer science (CS) classes at City College of San Francisco (CCSF), but found them really challenging. Lorena didn’t like the CS classes, until she started taking CSC 306 which is an intro to coding for biologists at SFSU. It was there when she learned that coding can be really useful for research, and she got a minor in Computer Application during her undergraduate at SFSU. \n",
        "\n",
        "Dr. Pleuni Pennings - First started learning to code in her PhD program. She had an advisor who encouraged her to learn programming and she discovered that programming (or coding, the two words are really the same) is fun and useful and not that hard at all (OK, sometimes it is hard, but nothing we can’t learn!)\n",
        "\n",
        "Florentine van Nouhuijs - Learned how to code just a year ago when she started in the SCIP Summer of 2021, learning Python. She took CSC 306 (which is part of the GOLD/PINC program) to learn more about Python. That is when she really started to love Python and wanted to learn more about Machine Learning. She figured machine learning is not as hard as it seems to be. In fact, YOU can learn it too!\n",
