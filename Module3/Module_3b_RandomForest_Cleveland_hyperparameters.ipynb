        "Whenever you create and train a machine learning model, you need to decide on hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are the settings of the model, set by you (or the defaults programmed by someone else). For example, for a decision tree, you need to decide on the maximum depth of the tree, and for a random forest you need to decide on how many trees you will create. It’s always a good idea to vary these parameters to find the best value of the hyperparameters for your model and your dataset. We do this in a process that we call “hyperparameter tuning”. During hyperparameter tuning, we may create a random forest many times, with a range of numbers of trees and then we determine how many trees are needed to get the best accuracy, without taking up too much computing power. We will practice hyperparameter tuning for the random forest model for the Cleveland dataset. \n"
